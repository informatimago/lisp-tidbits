|  Dijkstra spoke to Joel Aron (not Eyles), "head of IBM's Federal
|  Systems Division which had been responsible for the software of the
|  moonshot". It wasn't specifically in the lunar module, but somewhere
|  in the 40,000 LoC. However, the bug was that the moon was repelling;
|  and it was found by accident, 5 days before launch.
|  See Dijkstra say it in person, at 15:00 in this interview (context
|  starts at 13:40): http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/video.html (I
|  haven't linked directly to the 300MB download). Great interview BTW
|  (dutch with subtitles).
